# Authentication Tests Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of unit and integration tests for the authentication flows in our application, addressing edge cases like expired tokens and network failures.

## Overview

We've set up a comprehensive test suite for the authentication system that includes:

1. **Unit tests for authentication hooks**
2. **Component tests for auth UI components**
3. **Integration tests for complete auth flows**
4. **Specialized tests for edge cases**

## Test Structure

```

  ├── edge-cases.test.tsx          # Tests for edge cases (expired tokens, network failures)

  └── mocks/
      └── supabase.ts              # Mock implementation of Supabase client
```

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Testing Infrastructure

- **Jest Configuration**: Set up Jest for testing React components with TypeScript support.
- **Testing Library Setup**: Configured React Testing Library for component testing.
- **Mock Implementation**: Created robust mocks for Supabase auth client.

### 2. Unit Tests

- **Authentication Hook Tests**: Tests for the core `useAuth` hook that verify sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, and password reset functionality.

### 3. Auth Provider Tests

- **Context Provider Tests**: Tests that verify the `AuthProvider` component correctly manages auth state.
- **Error Handling**: Tests for proper error mapping and handling.

### 4. Edge Case Tests

Specific tests for handling edge scenarios:

- **Expired Tokens**: Tests for proper handling of JWT expiration.
- **Network Failures**: Tests for graceful handling of connectivity issues.
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests for handling API rate limits.
- **Unconfirmed Emails**: Tests for proper messaging when attempting to sign in with unconfirmed emails.

## Mocking Strategy

We've implemented a comprehensive mocking strategy:

1. **Supabase Auth Client**: A configurable mock that can simulate various success and error scenarios.
2. **Next.js Navigation**: Mocks for Next.js router and search params.
3. **Auth Context**: A testing wrapper for isolated component testing.

## Future Improvements

Several areas for future improvement:

1. **Complete Component Tests**: Finish implementing tests for all auth components.
2. **E2E Testing**: Add end-to-end tests for complete authentication flows.
3. **Mock Refinement**: Further refinement of mocks to better simulate real-world scenarios.

## Running Tests

Tests can be run with the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```
