# PIP Assistant Codebase Improvement Recommendations

## Component Organization
- Split the large page.tsx (406 lines) into smaller, more manageable components
- Create a dedicated sections directory for landing page sections
- Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable components

## Performance Optimization
- Implement image optimization with Next.js Image component instead of img tags
- Add proper loading and error states for data fetching
- Implement code splitting for larger components
- Add caching strategies for API calls

## Authentication Improvements
- Add proper error handling with more user-friendly messages
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add social authentication options (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- Create protected routes with middleware
- Improve session management

## Code Quality
- Add TypeScript interfaces for auth state and component props
- Implement form validation with a library like Zod
- Extract common UI patterns into reusable components
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Add proper JSDoc comments

## Testing
- Add unit tests for components and hooks
- Implement end-to-end testing for critical flows
- Add integration tests for API interactions
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

## User Experience
- Add loading states for authentication actions
- Implement proper form validation with meaningful error messages
- Add dark mode support
- Improve responsive design for all screen sizes
- Add animations for interactions

## SEO and Accessibility
- Add proper meta tags and structured data
- Improve accessibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Add keyboard navigation support
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Implement proper focus management

## Development Experience
- Set up linting and formatting tools
- Add proper documentation for components and hooks
- Implement storybook for component development
- Create a style guide for consistent UI development
- Add pre-commit hooks for code quality

## State Management
- Consider using a state management solution like Zustand for complex state
- Implement proper caching for API calls
- Create custom hooks for repeated logic
- Separate UI state from application state

## Environment Configuration
- Set up proper environment variable handling
- Implement feature flags for gradual feature rollout
- Add configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Secure sensitive environment variables
